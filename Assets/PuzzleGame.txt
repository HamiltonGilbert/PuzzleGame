TODO:
- keep track of move history for undo button
- finish testing first area
- implement final level in area where there is just one big bar for all the rules instead of individual
- make duplicate rules: NoFourInARowWhite, NO4InADiagonBlack
- make mirror rules (across diagonal, X, Y)
- make rules for white AND black (e.g. no 3 in a row of either color)
- rework solve initialization



Later TODO:
- fix board scaling issues
- make puzzles save board states of previous levels
- have left clicks switch tile color
- make art for fixed tiles
- make art for rules (figure out what kind of symbols to use)
- make art for numbered tiles (switch to shapes maybe?)
- make more levels
- look into puzzle design for better levels
- make puzzles that relate to numbered tiles, removed tiles, and fixed tiles
- allow player to click and drag to set tiles
	- decide what color to set tiles with a drag based on the tile originally pressed (eg clicking and dragging from a white tile sets tiles to black)
- add numbered tiles that must be connected by the same color
	- make this a rule?
	- if its a rule then other rules can use the numbers for other things like 3 means connected to only 2 other squares of its color to make a group of 3
	- or same numbers CANT be connected



Concept:
- puzzle type taken from logic puzzles in islands of insight
- rules/restrictions taken from understand (they have to be figured out as you go)


Eventually switch to 3d puzzles that use 2d rules along with 3d rules?
